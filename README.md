No more searches, just verifiably accurate answers.

## Project Description
Verif.ai project aims to address problem of halucinations in generative large language models and generative search, especially focusing on life sciences domain.
Verif.ai is an AI system designed to verify and document the correctness of AI-generated texts. In the core of the engine is generative search engine, powered by open technologies. However, generative models may halucinate, and therefore Verif.ai is developing a second model that would check the sources of generative model and flag any misinformation or misinterpretations of source documents. Therefore, make the answer created by generative search engine completly verifiable. The best part is, that we are making it open source, so anyone can use it!
